4-ish dialogues per scene 

  STAGE ONE
- pre stingray introduction
    -> basically explains a bit of exposition and why and how you're there
      the giant golden turtle being a species thought to be extinct on this magical 
      world, but you and your team have gotten readings of it possibly residing at 
      the very bottom of this underwater cave.
      
- radio buzzes
    1. answer
      -> explaination of lifesteal and where it may be useful
    2. ignore
      -> less chance of beating the game (skips right to post-stingray magic collection)
- post-stingray magic collection
    1. collect stingray magic 
      -> +2 mag, -1 ac
    2. don't touch magic
 - signal from team: dive deeper (effectively an explore round, you gain +1 lifesteal xp) 
    1. where?
      -> to the magma trenches. your reads indicate something promising in that direction
  
  STAGE TWO
- explore?
    1. yes
      -> +1 lifesteal xp (to defeat the leviathan, youll need at least 3 lifesteal xp)
    2. no
      -> your team reprimands you through the radio for not looking at your surroundings

      -> +2 mag, -1 ac
    2. don't touch magic
- chemistry degree? (radio team)
    1. "surely a fire-breathing dragon isn't possible, right?"
      -> the dragonfish is an important part of this regions ecosystem. be respectful, 
      its an endangered species.
   2. "can i do that fire thingy?"
      -> by exploring, you gain the ability to steal the health of the creatures you encounter
      and defeat, and you can collect their magic after defeating them. holding a lot of magic
      will make it a lot easier for creatures to hit you, though.
